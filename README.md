# Indie.js

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/mko/Indie.js.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

[Indie.js](http://indiejs.com) is an upcoming Node.js implementation of [IndieWeb](http://indiewebcamp.com) principles.

Exact features TBD, but the expectation is that it will reach a very high [IndieMark](http://indiewebcamp.com/IndieMark) out of the box.

## Usage

TBD. It'll probably be something like this:

```
var Indie = require('indie');

Indie();
```
